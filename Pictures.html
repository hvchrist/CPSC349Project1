        <p>This is a photo of my dog Midnight. It is one of my favorite photos. He unfortunatly
        passed away last September but he lived to be 16. He was my best friend and I am so happy to have
      had the time I did with him. I taught him how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sit</li>
      <li>Dance</li>
      <li>Open the Door</li>
      <li>Wait</li>
      <li>Jump</li>
    </ul>

          <img class ="center" src="Photos/Dice.jpg" alt="Dice on a Table"></a>
        <p>When I had free time, I used to dabble in Photography. This is one of my favorite photos because
        I had spun a dice infront of a stack of dice and happened to perfectly capture the '1' face. This was my goal
      and at the time I didn't know how to use Photoshop so it was a big accomplishment.</p>

        <a href="#">
          <img class ="center" src="Photos/Freshmen.jpg" alt="Elephant made of paper and blue tape"></a>
        <br><p>I am a very creative person. When I lived on campus, I hated how bare my walls were. So what I did was create an outline
        of an elephant in blue tape and filled in the rest using construnction tape. The whole thing costed me $10 and 4 hours of my time.
      I was such a big hit in the dorms that people from all of the floors wanted to see it. It made the place a lot more home-like.</p>
