    <p class = "p1">I am hoping to learn more about web development because my major is in Marketing
    and I have always been intrested in SEO. Although I love my Marketing SEO classes, I think they have a lot to teach me in terms of how to
    increase SEO and a general understanding how websites work.</p>
